        "description": "India's commitment to decarbonising its energy sector by 50 percent by 2030—expressed during the COP26 summit—is ambitious yet imperative. However, this pledge is shadowed by pressing challenges: the country remains heavily reliant on carbon-intensive industries, faces an ever-growing energy demand, and grapples with inadequate renewable energy infrastructure. Moreover, public awareness of ESG principles is startlingly low, creating a multi-faceted dilemma.",
